              Getting a team set up to work on a new software project can be quite time consuming. You have some great ideas for the code you want to write, but you can’t get down to writing it until you have a development environment for yourself and the rest of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, you have to select, download, and install tools. There are usually some settings that need to be configured for each one. Then, every other developer on the team needs to do the same thing, and you have to explain it, or write up instructions. This is even more challenging if some of your workers are remote or in different time zones.
            </p>
            <p>
              The more software you install, the more burdensome it is to keep it all up to date. As you update software, you need to make sure the rest of the team keep their environments updated to avoid consistency problems. After adding new versions of software to your environment, any instructions or scripts you wrote for onboarding new team members become out of date.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another problem with desktop development tools is lack of flexibility. Your work desktop might be configured with your perfect development environment but that doesn’t help you if you want to work from home, or need a loaner laptop while yours is out for repair. You might not be able to check your code to answer a question from a mobile device while travelling. Also, the heavyweight nature of desktop development environments can be a problem if you need to help another team with their code, or you need to pull in someone else.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might select some web-based software-as-a-service tools for your team, which can save you from installation hassles. However, many of these tools are point solutions that are their own islands of information. To use them effectively, it’s likely you will need to do some integration with the other tools your team uses.
            </p>
            <p>
              What you need is an end-to-end development platform in the cloud.

              To help development teams get started quickly and be productive, Red Hat created OpenShift.io. OpenShift.io is an end-to-end development environment for planning, building and deploying cloud-native applications. Using nothing more than a browser and an internet connection, a developer can quickly create a development platform for the entire team that is ready to go without downloading or installing any software.
            </p>
            <h3>An IDE configured for your project, no installation required</h3>
        		<p>
              You can work on all aspects of your project, including writing code, with just a browser in OpenShift.io. A powerful, next-generation IDE, Eclipse Che, is integrated into OpenShift.io. While it’s easy to focus on the browser-based code editing, what’s really important is that your developer workspace is running in a container, on OpenShift Online, as part of your OpenShift.io project space. This is truly cloud-native development.
            <p>
              When you launch Che from your project’s space on OpenShift.io, you get a development workspace that is configured for your project, with no setup required. This gives you  the flexibility to work from any device or location because the development workspace is on-line in the cloud. For collaboration, you can share a workspace with members of your team. If you need to switch to another project, you just open another browser tab.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though the experience is browser based, you get the features you expect from a desktop IDE. Intelligent, context-aware code completion assistance in your choice of programming languages is available via the built-in language server protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              The OpenShift.io IDE has functionality beyond what’s available in Eclipse Che. For example, OpenShift.io performs deep analysis of your technology stack. While editing manifests like Maven’s pom.xml, it can offer context-sensitive information, such as warnings about vulnerable versions of components, and give actionable advice.
            </p>
            <h3>Quick starts: the components of your stack, no download required</h3>
        		<p>
              When you create a space for your project on OpenShift.io, you can choose from a list of vetted development stacks called quick starts. Selecting a quick start adds a ready-to-use software project that follows best practices, to your space. All of the components of the stack are pulled in along with the information to automatically build the entire project into Linux containers.
            </p>
            <h3>Create, manage, and monitor your environments from a browser</h3>
        		<p>
              From within OpenShift.io, you can control all of the environments needed to move your project from planning to delivery. You can create, manage, and monitor testing, CI/CD, and deployment environments from the web-based console, as well as view logs, check status, and stop/start runtimes--all without installing any tools.
            </p>
            <h3>Plan, prioritize, and collaborate with OpenShift.io</h3>
        		<p>
              The whole team, including project managers and business analysts, can collaborate on OpenShift.io to understand the business needs, create work items, and schedule them into development cycles. And, you can check your assigned tasks, or view the team’s status without leaving OpenShift.io.
            </p>

              OpenShift.io combines the innovations of a number of open source projects including fabric8, Eclipse Che, Jenkins, JBoss Forge, WildFly Swarm, Vert.x, Kubernetes, and of course OpenShift. OpenShift.io itself is a container-based application delivered on Red Hat OpenShift Online.
